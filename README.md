The Whisper plugin is an implementation of the [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) speech recognition model developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as a [Vamp plugin](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/). The Whisper plugin analyses the text in the audio stream and generates markers corresponding to the tokens (words and/or syllables) found. The lightweight ggml-tiny model is embedded in the plugin (so you donâ€™t have to download anything to start experimenting), but it is possible to download and use other models that may be more appropriate to your needs.

The Whisper Vamp Plugin has been designed for use in the free audio analysis application [Partiels](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/partiels/).
